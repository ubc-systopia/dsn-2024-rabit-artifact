# Unsafe Test Cases

This repository contains the unsafe test cases that were used for evaluating the effectiveness of RABIT on the testbed. All test cases are experiment scripts that require `workflow_utils.py`, unless a test case has a specific `workflow_utils_test_case_no_<number>` file. Other files need to be added `deck.py` and  `dummy.py` in the repository, along with running the workflow.
