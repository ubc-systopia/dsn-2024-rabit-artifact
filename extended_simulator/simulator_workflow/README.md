# Running Testbed Workflows

## Helper python files
1) `dummy.py`: Defines the classes for the low-fidelity objects of the simulator.
2) `workflow_utils.py`: Defines helper functions for writing workflows.
3) `deck.py`: Initializes all devices in one file.

## Workflow
1) Set up and run the extended simulator as mentioned in the `setting_up_simulator` repository.
2) We have one workflow for the simulator that can run from the command terminal with the following command `python workflow_no_1.py`.
