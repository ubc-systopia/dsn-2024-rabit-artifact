# Unsafe Test Cases

This repository contains the unsafe test cases that were used for evaluating the effectiveness of RABIT on the extended simulator. All test cases are experiment scripts that require `workflow_utils_sim.py`, unless a test case has a specific `workflow_utils_sim_test_case_no_<number>` file. Other files need to be added `deck.py` and  `dummy.py`, along with running the workflow as specified in the [README.md](../simulator_workflow/README.md).
